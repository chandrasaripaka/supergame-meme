## üß≥ AI Travel Concierge ‚Äì Project Proposal

### **Overview**

We are looking to build an **AI-powered Travel Concierge web application** that helps users plan personalized travel experiences through a conversational interface. The app will leverage AI and third-party APIs to suggest destinations, create itineraries, and offer real-time travel insights tailored to user preferences.

---

### **Goals**

* Offer **intelligent travel recommendations** via a chat-based UI
* Integrate with travel-related APIs to fetch **real-time data** (flights, hotels, weather, etc.)
* Build **personalized itineraries** based on user inputs (budget, duration, interests)
* Provide an engaging and user-friendly web interface

---

### **Key Features**

1. **Conversational UI (Chat Interface)**

   * Users interact via natural language (e.g., ‚ÄúPlan a 5-day trip to Paris on a \$1500 budget‚Äù)
   * AI understands and responds with suggestions, queries, and feedback loops

2. **Destination Discovery**

   * Suggest places based on interests (adventure, culture, food, relaxation)
   * Fetch data using APIs like Google Places, Triposo, or similar

3. **Itinerary Builder**

   * Day-by-day plan generation with activities, travel options, and places to stay
   * Download/share option for itinerary

4. **Travel Data Integration**

   * Real-time flight and hotel availability via Skyscanner, Booking.com, or Amadeus APIs
   * Weather data via OpenWeather API

5. **User Preferences Storage**

   * Save favorite destinations, interests, and past plans (basic account system)

---

### **Tech Stack (Suggested)**

* **Frontend**: ReactJS or Next.js (for SPA or SSR)
* **Backend**: Node.js or Python (Flask/FastAPI)
* **AI/LLM**: OpenAI API or Cohere for prompt-based responses
* **Database**: Replit DB or Firebase
* **APIs**:

  * Flights/Hotels: Skyscanner, Amadeus, or Kiwi
  * Places & Activities: Google Places or Triposo
  * Weather: OpenWeather

---

### **Deliverables**

* Fully functional web app hosted on Replit
* Clean, responsive UI with chat functionality
* Integration with at least 2 major APIs (Flights + Weather or Places)
* Option to save/export itineraries
* ReadMe with deployment and usage instructions

---

### **Timeline**

* **Prototype UI & Chat logic** ‚Äì Week 1
* **API integration & Itinerary engine** ‚Äì Week 2
* **Testing, polish, and deployment** ‚Äì Week 3

---

### **Budget**

Open to proposals. Looking for fair pricing for MVP delivery within 2‚Äì3 weeks.

---

### **Additional Notes**

* Open to using no-code/low-code components if it speeds up delivery
* Bonus for multilingual support or voice interaction feature
