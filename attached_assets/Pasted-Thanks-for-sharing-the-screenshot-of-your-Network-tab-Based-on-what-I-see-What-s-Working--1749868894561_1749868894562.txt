Thanks for sharing the screenshot of your Network tab. Based on what I see:

### ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Working:

1. **Google Auth flow is starting**:

   * `consent?...` and `callback?code=...` are both **302 redirects** ‚Äî this is correct behavior for OAuth.
   * So, the **Google login completes successfully**, and your app is getting an **authorization code** from Google.

2. The callback is going to:

   ```
   /auth/google/callback?code=...
   ```

   ‚Äî which is expected in a standard OAuth flow.

3. The `status` request is returning a `304 Not Modified`, which means it‚Äôs checking auth status correctly but **still sees the user as unauthenticated**.

### ‚ùå What‚Äôs Likely Broken:

You're **not preserving the session** after Google login completes. This is why `isAuthenticated: false` keeps showing even after a successful callback.

### Most Common Causes:

| CORS misconfiguration           | `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` must be set on backend                   |
| Secure cookies on non-HTTPS dev | Cookies with `Secure` flag won‚Äôt work on `http://localhost`                       |

### üîß Fix Steps

**Frontend**

* In `axios` or `fetch`, add:

  ```js
  axios.post('/auth/google', { ... }, { withCredentials: true })
  axios.get('/status', { withCredentials: true })
  ```

**Backend (Node/Express)**

1. Set cookies with `res.cookie()` including:

   ```js
   res.cookie('token', jwt, {
     httpOnly: true,
     secure: true,           // Only on HTTPS
     sameSite: 'None'        // Required for cross-origin cookies
   });
   ```

2. Set CORS middleware correctly:

   ```js
   app.use(cors({
     origin: 'https://wander-notes.com',
     credentials: true
   }));
   ```

3. Make sure you‚Äôre using something like `express-session` **or** setting your own JWT token in the cookie.

### ‚úÖ To Confirm It's Fixed

After the Google callback:

* You should see a `Set-Cookie` header in the response from `/auth/google/callback`
* Then, the `/status` call should return `isAuthenticated: true` and user info

Would you like help reviewing your backend Google auth + session handling code? If you can share it (Node/Express), I can pinpoint the exact fix.
