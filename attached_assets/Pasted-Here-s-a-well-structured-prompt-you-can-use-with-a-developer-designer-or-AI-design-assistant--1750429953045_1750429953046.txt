Here’s a **well-structured prompt** you can use with a developer, designer, or AI design assistant (like Replit AI or Locofy) to convert the [**Wander Notes**](https://wander-notes.com/) website layout into one that resembles **Perplexity.ai**, while retaining your existing fonts and adding **subtle accordion-style UI** elements:

### 🧠 Design Transformation Prompt:

> **Goal:** Redesign the website [https://wander-notes.com](https://wander-notes.com) to follow a clean, modern layout inspired by [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai) while preserving brand identity and fonts.
>
> **Requirements:**
>
> 1. **Layout & Structure:**
>
>    * Convert the current card/list layout to a centered **feed-style Q\&A layout** similar to Perplexity.
>    * Include **search bar at top center** with subtle shadow and soft rounded edges.
>    * Implement a **responsive grid** that transitions smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
> 2. **Typography & Fonts:**
>
>    * Retain current site fonts and font hierarchy — **do not alter typeface**.
>    * Ensure text remains legible, clean, and minimalist across devices.
> 3. **Accordion UI Enhancements:**
>
>    * Add **accordion-style collapsible sections** for:
>
>      * Notes summary
>      * Tags / metadata
>      * Additional links or related content
>    * Accordion should appear subtle with a smooth animation (ease-in-out) and minimalistic caret toggle.
>    * Use hover effects and transitions that blend with the existing theme.
> 4. **Visual Feel & Design Tokens:**
>
>    * Match Perplexity’s **white/neutral background, minimalist UI, and soft border radius.**
>    * Keep existing color palette and brand aesthetics intact — no drastic shifts.
>    * Include subtle UI microinteractions (on hover, click).
> 5. **Accessibility & UX:**
>
>    * Ensure good contrast for readability.
>    * Smooth scroll behavior for internal sections.
>
> **Bonus Suggestions:**
>
> * Consider floating “Ask a question” button (Perplexity-style).
> * Add keyboard navigation and accessibility enhancements for accordion controls.
>
> Please implement this as a **React component layout**, or in HTML/CSS with a modular structure if using static site tools.
