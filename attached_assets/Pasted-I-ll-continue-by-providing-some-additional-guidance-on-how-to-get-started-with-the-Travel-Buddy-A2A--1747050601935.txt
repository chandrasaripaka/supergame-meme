I'll continue by providing some additional guidance on how to get started with the Travel Buddy A2A Agent Framework:

**How to Get Started (continued):**

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

2. Compile the TypeScript code
```bash
npm run build
```

3. Start the application
```bash
npm start
```

Let me create a sample implementation to demonstrate how agents might interact:

Now, let me explain the key additions and how they enhance the A2A framework:

### Agent Interaction Example Key Features

1. **Abstraction and Modularity**
   - `BaseAgent` provides a common interface for all agents
   - Agents can register themselves
   - Built-in task creation and status tracking
   - Supports dynamic capabilities declaration

2. **Specialized Agents**
   - `FlightBookingAgent`: Handles flight-related tasks
   - `AccommodationAgent`: Manages hotel searches and bookings
   - Each agent has its own API interaction logic

3. **Workflow Demonstration**
   - `demonstrateTravelAgentWorkflow()` shows how agents can collaborate
   - Agents can search for flights and hotels independently
   - Tasks are created and tracked through the orchestrator

### Benefits of this A2A Approach

- **Flexibility**: Easily add new agent types
- **Interoperability**: Standardized communication protocol
- **Scalability**: Agents can be added or modified without disrupting the entire system
- **Context Sharing**: Agents can pass context and results between each other

### Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Mock APIs to Real APIs**: Replace mock APIs with actual service integrations
2. **Error Handling**: Implement more robust error management
3. **Authentication**: Add security layers for agent communication
4. **Advanced Routing**: Develop more sophisticated task assignment algorithms

### Recommended Enhancements

1. Implement persistent storage for tasks and agents
2. Add more comprehensive logging
3. Create more specialized agents (e.g., Activity Planner, Translation Agent)
4. Develop a front-end interface for agent management

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the A2A framework or demonstrate how to extend it further?

Some potential next steps could include:
- Adding a Notification Agent
- Implementing more complex task routing
- Creating a front-end management interface
- Adding machine learning-based agent matching
